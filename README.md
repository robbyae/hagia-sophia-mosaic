This website is a technical demo for a concept to improve a viewer's understanding of any art piece. It is an interactive application where a mosaic in the Hagia Sophia is displayed, and its most important elements are hoverable. Upon clicking an element, information about that particular element is displayed on the page. This was developed without a specialized art historian, so all text is placeholder.

The site is made with HTML, CSS, JS (Jquery). The hoverable elements are created with Affinity Designer (essentially Adobe Illustrator).
